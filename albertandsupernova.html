<h1> A-Level - One Heading </h1> </h1>Hello World!
<p> This page has a picture of the <em>super</em> nova.</p>
<p>And I love HTML entities! &mdash; especially &amp;55-096059<p/>
<p>The super nova is a stellar explosion that briefly outshines an entire galaxy.</p>.</p>.</p>

<p> Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and Super Nova effect.  Scientists say the display confirmed an effect predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity 100 years ago.

The exploding star, known as a supernova, was directly behind a cluster of huge galaxies whose enormous mass warped space-time, creating a cosmic magnifying glass.

This caused light from the death of the star to produce four separate images as it passed through the distorted area. 

Dr Brad Tucker, from The Australian National University, said: "It's perfectly set up, you couldn't have designed a better experiment. You can test some of the biggest questions about Einstein's theory of relativity all at once."

Dr Patrick Kelly, from the University of California at Berkeley, US, made the discovery while searching for distant galaxies.

"It really threw me for a loop when I spotted the four images surrounding the galaxy - it was a complete surprise," he said.

The find not only acts as a test of general relativity, but also provides information about the strength of gravity and the amount of dark matter and dark energy in the universe.

The observation forms part of a special report on general relativity in the journal Science marking the centenary of the theory published in December 1915.
